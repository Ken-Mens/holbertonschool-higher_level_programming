# 0x12. Javascript - Warm up

## Learning Objectives

- How to run a Javascript script
- How to create variables and constants
- What are differences between var, const and let


## Task 0
Write a script that prints “Javascript is amazing”

## Task 1
Write a script that prints 3 lines

## Task 2
Script that prints a message depending of the number of arguments passed

## Task 3 
Write a script that prints the first argument passed to it:
- If no arguments are passed to the script, print “No argument”
- You must use console.log(...) to print all output
- You are not allowed to use var
- You are not allowed to use length

## Task 4
Write a script that prints two arguments passed to it, in the following format: “ is ”

## Task 5
Write a script that prints My number: <first argument converted in integer> if the first argument can be converted to an integer

## Task 6
Write a script that prints 3 lines: (like 1-multi_languages.js) but by using an array of string and a loop

## Task 7
Write a script that prints x times “C is fun”
- Where x is the first argument of the script
- If the first argument can’t be converted to an integer, print “Missing number of occurrences”
- You must use console.log(...) to print all output
- You are not allowed to use var
- You can use only two console.log
- You must use a loop (while, for, etc.)

## Task 8
Write a script that prints a square
- The first argument is the size of the square
- If the first argument can’t be converted to an integer, print “Missing size”
- You must use the character X to print the square
- You must use console.log(...) to print all output
- You are not allowed to use var
- You must use a loop (while, for, etc.)


## Task 9
Write a script that prints the addition of 2 integers
- The first argument is the first integer
- The second argument is the second integer
- You have to define a function with this prototype: function add(a, b)
- You must use console.log(...) to print all output
- You are not allowed to use var

## Task 10
Write a script that computes and prints a factorial
- The first argument is integer (argument can be cast as integer) used for computing the factorial
- Factorial of NaN is 1
- You must do it recursively
- You must use a function
- You must use console.log(...) to print all output
- You are not allowed to use var

## Task 11
Write a script that searches the second biggest integer in the list of arguments.

## Task 12
Update script to replace the value 12 with 89

## Task 13
Write a function that returns the addition of 2 integers.

## Task 14
Write a file that modifies the value of myVar to 333
